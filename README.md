Q: What problems did you face while implementing a specific feature?
A: During the implementation of the Google OAuth authentication feature using Passport.js and JWT, I encountered a redirect URI error. This error prevented the Google OAuth from functioning correctly. To resolve the issue, I searched for solutions on Stack Overflow, which helped me identify and fix the problem.

Q: How much documentation did you read while implementing a feature?
A: I relied on multiple sources of documentation. Firstly, I referred to the official documentation of Passport.js, the library used for authentication. This documentation provided detailed explanations of the required steps and configurations for implementing the Google OAuth strategy. Additionally, I also consulted a related blog post that covered the implementation of Google OAuth using Passport.js. The blog post provided practical examples and additional insights into the integration process.
